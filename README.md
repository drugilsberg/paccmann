# DISCLAIMER:
This code gives the `tensorflow` implementation of PaccMann as of our paper in [Molecular Pharmaceutics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.9b00520). For new developments and `pytorch` implementations look at our [PaccMann organization](https://github.com/PaccMann/).

# PaccMann

`paccmann` is a package for drug sensitivity prediction and is the core component of the repo.

The package provides a toolbox of learning models for IC50 prediction using drug's chemical properties and tissue-specific cell lines gene expression.

## Installation

### Setup of the virtual environment

We strongly recommend to work inside a virtual environment (`venv`).

Create the environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Module installation

The module can be installed either in editable mode:

```sh
pip3 install -e .
```

Or as a normal package:

```sh
pip3 install .
```

## Models training

Models can be trained using the script `bin/training_paccmann` that is installed together with the module. Check the [examples](https://github.com/drugilsberg/paccmann/tree/master/examples) for a quick start.
For more details see the help of the training command by typing `training_paccmann -h`:
